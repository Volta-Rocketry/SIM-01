They are responsible for:

## 9. Amendments to This Governance

* Changes to this governance document are considered strategic decisions.
* Amendments require the same approval process defined in Section 6.

## 10. Institutional Oversight

If the project is hosted under a university or research institution:

* The institution may act as a neutral custodian.
* The institution does not automatically gain relicensing rights unless explicitly approved through the strategic decision process.
